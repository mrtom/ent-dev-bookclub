After upgrading from @lolopinto/ent to @snowtop/ent I'm unable to run npm codegen, seems like it's using the old tsent CLI still.

To work around this for now I've installed tsent locally. To get this to work you need to have some things on the path.

Make sure the following are added: /Users/tom/Library/Python/3.8/bin:/Users/tom/go/bin
